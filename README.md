# Rock Paper Scissors

## About
This webpage plays a game of rock, paper, scissors. This was created as part of TOP: Fundamentals.
Ver 1 will play out in the console.
Ver 2 will have a GUI that allows user to play through the browser.

## Goals
* Pick a random choice of RPS
* Take input from user
* Display outcome of match (win, lose, draw)

## Thoughts
It is surprising how much code is needed to run a simple game like rock paper scissors.
I would love to spend a little more time on this and get the readouts to happen on the page
instead of in the console. However, it sounds like this will happen in the future during
TOP so I won't worry about it right now.

One note: I added an extra function to check user input and reject anything that is not
"rock" "paper" or "scissors" (or any caps variation of those words). I think this was a
decent QOL improvement as it won't stop the game if invalid input is submitted, it will
just wait to receive valid input before continuing.
