# Rock Paper Scissors

## About
This webpage plays a game of rock, paper, scissors. This was created as part of TOP: Fundamentals.
Ver 1 will play out in the console.
Ver 2 will have a GUI that allows user to play through the browser.

## Goals
* Pick a random choice of RPS
* Take input from user
* Display outcome of match (win, lose, draw)

## Thoughts
It is surprising how much code is needed to run a simple game like rock paper scissors.
I decided to change the game slightly to make it a little more interesting. The new version
is called "Zombie, man, gun" and works with the same mechanics and playstyle but with
updated characters.
I decided to make the webpage in the style of a retro game after finding an interesting font.
I also added a few QOL improvements like a button to show/hide the rules and a big "GAME OVER'
popup upon one player reaching 5 wins.
